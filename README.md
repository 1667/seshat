seshat: handwritten math expression parser
==========================================
*Seshat* is an open source system for recognizing handwritten
mathematical expressions. Given a sample represented as a sequence of
strokes, the parser is able to translate it to LaTeX or other formats
like InkML or MathML. You can see an example of application of this
parser in

http://cat.prhlt.upv.es/mer/

where *seshat* is the underlying engine.

This parser has been developed by Francisco Álvaro as part of his PhD
thesis. Hi is a member of the [PRHLT research group] [1] at
Universitat Politècnica de València [2].

*Seshat* represents a state-of-the-art system that has recently
participated in several international competitions [3]. It was awarded
the best system using training set in

  of Online Mathematical Expressions*.

  Recognition, ICDAR 2013, Washington DC, USA (2013)


Current state
-------------
As part of a research study, *seshat* has suffered many modifications
in the last years, always trying new techniques while looking for the
best system. There is still work to do, but we think we have a good
parser ready to be released to the public domain.

Right now I am cleaning and documenting the code, hence, I expect to
have it ready soon.
